# Create a new project

To create a new project, we need to run command:

```bash
npm create tutorial
```

This command will prompt you to enter some information <span style="font-size: 1.5rem">ðŸ™Œ</span>

## What is inside the project?

If you're already familiar with [Astro](https://astro.build/), the generated project should feel very familiar! <span style="font-size: 1.5rem">ðŸ¥‚</span>

If you examine the project, you'll see that it's simply an Astro-based application that sets up an Astro integration using the `@tutorialkit/astro` library.

This library, `@tutorialkit/astro`, configures a series of integrations. Some of them include:

- `@astrojs/mdx`
- `@astrojs/react`
- `astro-expressive-code`
- `unocss/astro`

# Look and feel

You can configure the look and feel of your TutorialKit by changing the theme, colors, and fonts.

Check the official documentation to learn more about [theming](https://tutorialkit.dev/reference/theming).

## Components

TutorialKit provides a config to override some components of the ui.

For example, this instance of tutorialkit has a custom `TopBar` component to add Githug repo link.

Check the official documentation to learn more about [components](https://tutorialkit.dev/guides/overriding-components/).

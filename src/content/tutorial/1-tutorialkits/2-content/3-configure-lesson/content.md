# Configuration

You can configure the appearance and behavior of a `TutorialKit` lesson by setting up properties in the `lessonâ€™s frontmatter block`.

Some configurations can be specified at tutorial, part or chapter level, and they will be inherited and/or overridden by the lesson configuration.

Most common properties are:

- `title`: The title of the lesson.
- `slug`: The URL slug of the lesson.
- `focus`: The file or code block to focus on when the lesson is opened.
- `editor`: The editor configuration.
- `terminal`: The terminal configuration.
- `previews`: The preview configuration.
- `template`: The template to use for the lesson preview.

You can find the rest of the properties in the [official documentation](https://tutorialkit.dev/reference/configuration/).

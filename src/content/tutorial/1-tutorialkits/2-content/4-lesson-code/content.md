# Lesson code

Beside the `content.md` file in a lessonâ€™s directory, you will find two folders:

- `\_files`
- `\_solution`

The `\_files` folder contains any code files that are part of the lesson. You can place any number of files in this folder.

The `\_solution` folder contains the code for the lesson in its solved state.

## Example

We added a `sum.js` file to this lesson to show you the result.

The lesson files looks like:

- `content.md`
- `\_files/sum.js`
- `\_solution/sum.js`

And the lesson content is like:

```md

## Context scoped state management with provide/inject

In this lesson, we will learn how to manage context-scoped state in Vue with provide/inject.

### Introduction

The provide/inject API allows us to provide a value to all descendants of a component.

### When to use provide/inject for context-scoped state

This approach is useful when the prop drilling is overkill due to the number of components that need to share the state.

### Creating context-scoped state with provide/inject

Check the file `Orders.vue` to see an example of provide/inject state management.

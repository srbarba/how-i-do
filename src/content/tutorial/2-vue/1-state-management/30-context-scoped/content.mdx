## Context scoped state management

In this lesson, we will learn how to manage context-scoped state in Vue.

### Introduction

With context-scoped we mean any state that is shared in our application but is not global.

For example:

- State shared between components by prop drilling
- State shared between components by provide/inject

Similarly to self-contained state, context-scoped state is linked to a component lifecycle.

### When to use context-scoped state

This approach is useful when the state is shared between components but you don't need it to be global.

The advantage of this approach compared to global state is that the state is linked to a component lifecycle.

Once the component is destroyed, the state is also destroyed.

### Creating context-scoped state

#### Prop drilling

Check the file `Orders.vue` to see an example of context-scoped state management with prop drilling.

In `Orders.vue`, we have a `searchTerm` ref that is shared between the `OrdersFilters` and `OrderList` components.

#### Provide/Inject

Check next lesson to see an example of context-scoped state management with provide/inject.
